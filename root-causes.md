## Problem 1

**Problem**: The tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: Underlying Issue: This issue typically occurs when a string intended to be treated as a single tag is inadvertently split into individual characters. This can happen if the code iterates over a string instead of an array of strings. For example, using a loop or a directive like *ngFor on a string will iterate over each character instead of treating the entire string as a single tag.

Originating Component: This issue likely originates from the component or template responsible for displaying tags, such as the tags-list.component.html. If the tags input was incorrectly handled as a single string instead of an array of strings, it would cause this behavior. Ensuring that tags is always an array of strings and verifying the data binding in the template would resolve this issue.


## Problem 2

**Problem**: New tags  are not shown on the home page under "Popular Tags", even after a page refresh.

**Question**: What is the underlying issue that causes this problem to occur and from which component (file) of this project does this issue originate?

**Answer**: Underlying Issue: The main issue here was that the tags were not being refreshed or updated correctly in the application state after new articles were created. This can occur if the method responsible for fetching or updating tags is not called after an article creation, or if the state management logic does not correctly update the list of tags.

Originating Component: This issue was primarily related to the home.component.ts and potentially the HomeStoreService. The loadTags method was not being called after creating a new article, or the tags were not being stored and updated correctly in the state management system. By ensuring that the tags are fetched and the state is updated after each article creation, the problem was resolved.

Conclusion
For both problems, the key was ensuring proper data handling and state management:

Problem 1 was resolved by ensuring tags are handled as arrays of strings.
Problem 2 was resolved by implementing logic to refresh and update tags in the application state after creating new articles.
